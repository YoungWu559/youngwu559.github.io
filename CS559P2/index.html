        <p>This workbook is due on Tuesday, December 9, 2025.</p><p>This workbook is a chance to put everything from class together!</p>
<p>There is one big box: Graphics Town. It is a separate page on <a href="./docs/1/">Page &nbsp;1&nbsp; (Graphics Town)</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than having a lot of small boxes, there is a single big window. And in it, you get to make a world. It&rsquo;s a chance for you to be creative and make something cool.</p>
<p>We realize that you have limited time to do this, so our expectations are reasonable.</p>
<p>A key rule of graphics town: you only get points for what you document in the Workbook Form (or in the html file below the Canvas)! If you do it, but don&rsquo;t describe it (as the instructions tell you), you didn&rsquo;t do it (unless it is obvious).</p>
<h2>Learning Goals</h2>
<ol>
    <li>To gain experience applying the concepts from class in order to create something more interesting</li>
    <li>To apply texturing techniques to create appearances</li>
    <li>To practice fitting different types of models together to make a scene</li>
    <li>To experiment with methods for creating objects and behaviors</li>
    <li>To experiment with advanced interactive graphics techniques</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="due-date-and-grading">Due Date and Grading</h2>
<p>The assignment is due the last day of class. We cannot accept late assignments.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;rubric&rdquo; is given at on <a href="./docs/4/">Page &nbsp;4&nbsp; (Graphics Town Rubric)</a>, but be warned: it is not the specific &ldquo;point counting&rdquo; rubrics we have had for prior assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> as with Workbooks, you must both commit and push your work to GitHub as well as complete the Workbook Form.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-collaboration">A Note on Collaboration</h2>
<p>Every student must turn in an assignment: you are not allowed to work in groups. Please be sure to give attributions.</p>
