                <h2>Spring 2025 Sample Solution</h2>
                <p>This is a sample solution for the Workbook.
                    You are welcome to refer to it to learn one way to do the assignment
                    but only after you have turned in your own assignment
                </p>
            </div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the first workbook for CS559!</p>
<p>The right way to use this workbook, and any of the following ones, is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the workbook from GitHub</li>
<li>Serve the folder using a local server</li>
<li>Start by looking at the index.html file in the web browser</li>
<li>Follow the instructions</li>
<li>While working, you&rsquo;ll change files (generally only ones in the <code>for_students</code> directory)</li>
<li>As you make changes, you should periodically commit them to GIT so you have a backup. You can push them to GitHub as well.</li>
<li>When you are done, make sure everything it committed and pushed, then complete the Workbook Form.</li>
</ol>
<p>The fact that you are looking at this means you probably have done the first three of those steps!</p>
<p>You probably want to do all this with Visual Studio Code and the Live Server extension. Open the workbook directory in VSCode and start LiveServer (it should know to open the index page in your browser)</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already read the general instructions for workbooks, see the page on the course web site. It explains some of the things that you have to do.</p>
<p>Note: this workbook is a little wordier and more &ldquo;make sure you know how to do things&rdquo; than future ones are likely to be. This workbook is to make sure you are ready to do programming. Later ones will be more about doing some programming.</p>
<p>In the future, we&rsquo;ll be doing graphics programming.
This workbook is about making sure you are ready!
Future workbooks will have you do more programming, and less plain reading.</p>
<h2 id="learning-goals">Learning Goals</h2>
<p>Each workbook will start by telling you what it is trying to teach you.</p>

<h2>Learning Goals</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Understand and use the class mechanics (GitHub classroom links, Git, local servers, editing pages, &hellip;)</li>
    <li>Understand the organization of workbooks for the class (looking at pages, boxes, editing and adding things, turning things in)</li>
    <li>Review basic HTML that you will need for class</li>
    <li>Practice basic JavaScript and understand how to attach programs to web pages</li>
    <li>Make interactions and animations with JavaScript web pages</li>
    <li>Differentiate and use event-driven- and animation-loop-driven- programming</li>
    <li>Understand how to control timing with browser animation loops</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="local-server-check">Local Server Check</h2>
<p>You should always &ldquo;run&rdquo; the web pages served by a local server.
See the <a href="https://cs559.github.io/559Tutorials/tools-and-setup/559tools/" target="_blank">Tools for 559</a> page for more information.
Using a local server requires both running the server <em>and</em> having the web browser look at the server. If you don&rsquo;t use a local server (and instead you just open the file in the web browser), problems can happen.</p>
<p>We have no way to check if you are using a local server. Some of the web pages will break in weird ways. Look at the URL bar in your browser: if this page says &ldquo;http://127.0.0.1:5500/&rdquo; or &ldquo;http://localhost:5500/&rdquo; or something similar, you are using a local server. If the URL starts with &ldquo;file:&rdquo; or something like that, you are not using a local server.</p>
<p>Make sure that you know how to use a local server. That&rsquo;s a goal of this assignment -
we will need it for future assignments. Re-read the  <a href="https://cs559.github.io/559Tutorials/tools-and-setup/559tools/" target="_blank">Tools for 559</a> page, and ask for help, if you need it.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-should-do-with-this-workbook">What you should do with this workbook</h2>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already done it, please review the pages on the Course Website. The <strong>Getting Started</strong> page is a good place to get started. You should do everything there. The fact that you found this workbook and got this far means you&rsquo;ve done at least some reading.</p>
<p>The course web explains the workbooks in detail, including the content, how you turn them in, what you should do with them, how they are graded, and the late policy. But the <strong>Workbooks</strong> page was part of the <strong>Getting Started</strong> list, so hopefully you have read it.</p>
<p>Workbooks consist of a series of pages. There is always an &ldquo;index&rdquo; page (what you are reading). This is where you start. Then there is a series of &ldquo;regular&rdquo; pages for you to read. These will be numbered, and they will be linked together (so each one will lead to the next). You can see the list of pages in the &ldquo;navigation&rdquo; box (which should be in the upper right corner, unless your screen is too small). These pages will be in the <code>docs</code> directory of the workbook. You are welcome to look at the html for these files, but you generally don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>The workbook pages will contain &ldquo;boxes&rdquo;. These boxes contain examples that you should look at. Some of them you will just need to read (you will read code in order to learn how it works). Often, you will be asked to change the contents of these boxes. The contents of the boxes will be in the <code>for_students</code> directory. You should avoid changing files that are outside of the <code>for_students</code> directory. If you change a file (in the <code>for_students</code> directory) you need to commit these changes and push them back to GitHub for us to see the changes (see the <a href="https://cs559.github.io/559Tutorials/tools-and-setup/git559/" target="_blank">Git and GitHub in CS559</a> page if you don&rsquo;t understand commit and push).</p>
<p>Sometimes, we will ask you to add files to a workbook. When you add a file, put it into the <code>for_students</code> directory (or a subdirectory of it). Don&rsquo;t forget to use <code>git add</code> to add the file to the repository so you can commit and push it to GitHub. You will need to add files for this workbook for one of the boxes.</p>
<p>You should work through the pages and their boxes in order.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re done, don&rsquo;t forget to commit your work and push it back to the GitHub repo that GitHub classroom made for you!</p>
<h2 id="readings">Readings</h2>
<p>The pages of this workbook are required reading! That includes reading the web pages, but also, reading the source code of the boxes. (the pages will tell you which files you should read)</p>
<p>Other readings are sprinkled across the pages of this workbook. Some things that you should make sure that you read along the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>You should look at the course web and 559 tutorials web in general, but particularly all the pages discussed on the <strong>Getting Started</strong> page. I&rsquo;ve already said that multiple times.</li>
<li>Some resources on HTML and CSS (if you aren&rsquo;t already familiar). You just need to know the basics. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML" target="_blank">Mozilla HTML Learning Guide</a> site is a great resource.</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t understand how we are using colors (like why <code>#FF0000</code> is red), have a look at the <a href="https://cs559.github.io/559Tutorials/color/color1/" target="_blank">CS559 Color Tutorial</a>.</li>
<li>If you are learning JavaScript, look at the resources on the <a href="https://cs559.github.io/559Tutorials/javascript/javascript559/" target="_blank">Javascript in CS559</a> page.</li>
<li>You should practice using the debugger. We have a separate tutorial on how to use the debugger in VSCode <a href="https://github.com/CS559/DebuggerTutorial" target="_blank">Debugger Tutorial (GitHub Repository)</a>. If you want to try using the debugger built into Chrome (easier to get started, but not as good when the programs get complicated), we have a video <a href="https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/media/Chrome&#43;Debugger&#43;Quick&#43;Start&#43;for&#43;CS&#43;559&#43;%282019%29/1_77oepxqr" target="_blank">Chrome Debugger Quick Start for CS 559 (2019 Video)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For this week, there are no regular readings (book chapters). Those will start in the next week or two.</p>
<h2 id="due-date-grading-and-rubric">Due Date, Grading and Rubric</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget: to hand in this workbook you must both turn it in via GitHub (<code>commit</code> your work and <code>push</code> it to GitHub), but also complete the Workbook Form. The graders will not know your assignment is ready until you submit the Workbook Form!</p>
<p>Please Figure out how to do workbooks now - we have many more this semester. It is important that you can keep up with the schedule.</p>
<p>The scale is described on the <strong>Grading</strong> page for the course web.</p>
<p>You can see a rubric for the entire workbook at the bottom of this page. The rubric contains the list of basic and advanced items you can complete. Advanced items are more work to complete - focus on getting the basic items first. It is difficult to make up for missing basic things by getting advanced points.</p>
<p>If you fall behind, you are better off finishing the basic items and moving on to the next thing in class (otherwise, you will fall behind farther).</p>
