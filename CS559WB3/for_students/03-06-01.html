    <p>The first simple example implements the basic requirements.
    </p>

    <canvas id="canvas1" height="600px" width="600px"></canvas>
    <script src="03-06-01bs.js" type="module" defer></script>

    <p>Another example (note: this does not fill all the requirements, so it would not get all the basic points!): </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click mouse to pick a target position, the quadcopter moves there.
        <li>You can click another position before the quadcopter reaches its current target position.
    </ul>

    <canvas id="canvas2" height="600px" width="600px"></canvas>
    <script src="03-06-01ad.js" type="module" defer></script>

    <p>The next example implements the following features with three QuadCopters:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The first one (best attempt to look like the Helicarrier from the Avengers) responds to mouse clicks. Each
            mouse click adds a person waving at the QuadCopter. While there are no mouse clicks, a random person could
            be added with a small probability.
        <li>The second one (best attempt to look like the Gunship from Avatar) responds to arrow keys and the WASD keys
            (QEZC also works).
        <li>The third one (plain QuadCopter with Red-Green-Blue colors) just flies in circles.</li>
    </ol>
