Please indicate the features you have implemented here by putting an "x" (i.e. "[x]") and a brief explanation of what the graders need to do to see it:

# Basic features:
[x] equipment 1 is identifiable (can tell what it is): wrecking ball made by Kevin Wilson
[x] equipment 2 is identifiable: forklift made by Gia-Phong Nguyen
[x] equipment 1 has correct articulation: 5 degrees of freedom
[x] equipment 2 has correct articulation: 3 degrees of freedom
[x] UI works for 1&2: yes

# Bonus features:
[x] third machine identifiable with working articulation: robotic arm
[x] nice shapes: wrecking ball made by Kevin Wilson
[x] good use of colors/materials: wrecking ball made by Kevin Wilson
[x] more than the minimum degrees of freedom on the objects: robotic arm
[x] at least one object has 4+ d.o.f. (beyond position/orientation): robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom
[x] other coolness (describe below): robotic arm default configurations
    [something else you did that was cool]

Artistic merit points are at the discretion of the grader.

Note: please refer to the workbook instructions and rubrics for the detailed requirements.
