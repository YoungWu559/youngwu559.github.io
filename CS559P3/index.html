        <p>This workbook is due on Tuesday, December 16, 2025.</p><p>This is the workbook for the group project and can be completed by 1 to 4 students (recommended group size is 2 or 3).</p>
<h2 id="content-requirements">Content Requirements</h2>
<p>The project should be displayed on a public GitHub Page (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site">instructions</a>) or a UW Madison CS Department personal webpage (<a href="https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/docs/csl/2012-08-16-web/">instructions</a>) in a single HTML Canvas that uses THREE.js. It can be any small video/mobile game or an interactive visualization/simulation.</p>
<p>There needs to be two modes of the game (either two separate pages or a button/checkbox to switch between the modes).</p>
<ul>
<li>Prototype: all objects are primitive geometries with no image textures.</li>
<li>Full: allows loaded objected and textures.</li>
</ul>
<p>For all groups,</p>
<ul>
<li>The user should be able to interact using mouse and touch or keyboard: to control the movement of one or more objects in the scene (or the camera). For keyboard interactions, consider on-screen buttons or other alternatives so that the projects can be viewed on mobile devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>For groups with three or more students,</p>
<ul>
<li>Other objects in the scene should be animated, even when there is no user interaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>For groups with four students, one of the following should be implemented.</p>
<ul>
<li>Game opponents or non-playable characters that perform meaningful actions, demonstrating multiple levels of difficulty or complexity.</li>
<li>Game levels are randomized and designed with multiple levels of difficulty.</li>
<li>Auto-play options to demonstrate the solution or walk-through of the game.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="submission-requirements">Submission Requirements</h2>
<p>Each project will be evaluated by four components.</p>
<ul>
<li>Game design: the overall gameplay or story.</li>
<li>User interaction: implementation of the game mechanics.</li>
<li>Animation: character and environment animation.</li>
<li>Automation: control of non-playable characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be a separate Workbook Form <a href="https://forms.gle/iybe98pH26PTJUMb8">link</a> for this project. Every student should submit the Workbook Form and include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Wisc NetID.</li>
<li>Your group name and a four-digit group ID (this ID should be displayed at the top of your web page).</li>
<li>The link to your project GitHub Page (something like <a href="https://youngwu559.github.io/train.html">the Train</a> it should not be a link to an GitHub Repository).</li>
<li>Which ones of the four components did you make the most contribution to (each component can be only claimed by one group member).</li>
<li>Notes (you can include attributions, addition updates and improvements after the presentation, etc).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="peer-evaluation">Peer Evaluation</h2>
<p>All students are encouraged to evaluate other students&rsquo; submissions, and can earn up to 5 points from submitting valid evaluations <a href="https://forms.gle/TLZ15GwTsEA7G4LBA">link</a> (one submission for each group: please enter your Wisc NetID and the Four-digit Group ID for the group you are evaluating).</p>
<ul>
<li>5: Submitted at least 20 valid evaluations with 5 rated 5 in each category.</li>
<li>4: Submitted at least 16 valid evaluations with 4 rated 5 in each category.</li>
<li>3: Submitted at least 12 valid evaluations with 3 rated 5 in each category.</li>
<li>2: Submitted at least 8 valid evaluations with 2 rated 5 in each category.</li>
<li>1: Submitted at least 4 valid evaluations with 1 rated 5 in each category.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each component of each project can be rated one of the following,</p>
<ul>
<li>5: Best in the class: requires explanation and at most one quarter of your evaluations in each category can be 5.</li>
<li>4: Better than average.</li>
<li>3: Average.</li>
<li>2: Below average.</li>
<li>1: Not applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p>For an evaluation to be considered valid:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correct four digit group ID (for the group you are evaluating).</li>
<li>Correct summary (1-2 sentences) of the game/visualization.</li>
<li>Components that are not implemented should receive a rating of 1.</li>
<li>Components that are implemented should not receive a rating of 1.</li>
<li>Components rated 5 should have a valid explanation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>The grade will be based on your ranking of your score in class. The score is computed as the maximum score over all components you claimed, and the component score is computed as the average of the weighted average of student evaluations and the average of the course staff evaluations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Score = 0.5 average student scores + 0.5 average course staff scores.</li>
</ul>
<p>| - | Ranking | Grade |
| Top 10% | 10% | 10 |
| Next 10% | 20% | 9 |
| Next 10% | 30% | 8 |
| Next 10% | 40% | 7 |
| Next 10% | 50% | 6 |
| Next 10% | 60% | 5 |
| Next 10% | 70% | 4-5* |
| Next 10% | 80% | 3-5* |
| Next 10% | 90% | 2-5* |
| Next 10% | 100% | 1-5* |</p>
<p>(*) The grades will be lower-bounded by the average score received.</p>
