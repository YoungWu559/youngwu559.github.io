Where did you get your shader? Describe the source and include a link.

The original shader is from The Book of Shaders (https://thebookofshaders.com/edit.php#08/cross-animated.frag) 

The original shader is a black background with a white plus sign that spins around in a circle while rotating
itself. I played around with it to make a funky background color and make it rotate in a more unpredictable way.


In your own words, describe how this shader works. (3-5 sentences)

This shader creates a cross out two boxes. These boxes are themselves made of anti-aliased pixels. The position
of where to place the box pixels is always being updated, and the color is updated with the boxes' positions. The position is updated using rotation and translate transformations, going one direction and then back to the
original position. I changed the rotations from the original so the movement would look more random and not as fixed. I also played around with the lighting so it would be unpredicatable and change quickly.
