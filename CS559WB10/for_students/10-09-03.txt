Explain what your shader does and how it works.

Shader 0:

The shader generates a series of waves that oscillate down from the top to the bottom.
It simply uses a sin function to determine the mix between the two colors as well as the height from the normal at that point.
Using the first slider, you can control how tall the waves are (the amplitude).
Using the second slider, you can control how many waves there are at the time (basically the frequency).
Using the third slider, you can control how fast the waves propagate.
There is also a light source shining from the top right, which can only be noticed on the sphere.

Shader 1:

The shader gets the values of the blue, red, green sections of the passed in uniform image (named 'tex' in the shaders)
Using the slider, you can change the 'heights' of these sections. Each of the sections behaves differently
to the slider value, giving the shader a kind of random look. For example, the higher the value of the slider, the taller the blue sections and shorter the red sections.
The shader does this by manipulating the positions in the vertex shader,and the fragment shader acts on these manipulated positions. 
The fragment shader also does some lighting to make it appear like the material is glowing.
